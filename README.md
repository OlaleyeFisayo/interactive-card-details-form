## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS/SASS

### What I learned

- SCSS, the CSS replacement, was something I learned and used in my coding.
- I learned how to mask input text values according to a specific pattern. I would have done more, but I had to limit myself for the sake of the challenge.
-I discovered a method to add a linear gradient to borders.


### Useful resources

- [Akifcan Kara](https://youtu.be/JjGN2ZHXvEk) - This made my input tag values more concealable.
